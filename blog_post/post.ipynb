    "# Data Enrichment for ML Model Deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous blog post](https://www.tekhnoal.com/ml-model-decorators.html) we introduced the decorator pattern for ML model deployments and then showed how to use the pattern to build extensions for machine learning models. The extensions that we showed in the previous post were added without having to modify the machine learning model code at all, we were able to do it by creating a decorator class that wrapped the model. In this blog post we’ll use decorators to add data enrichment capabilities to an ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models need data to make predictions. When deploying a model to a production setting, this data is not necessarily available from the client system that is requesting the prediction. When this happens, some other source is needed for the data fields that are required by the model but not provided by the client system. The process of accessing the data and joining it to the client's prediction request is called data enrichment. In all cases, the model itself should not need to be modified in order to do data enrichment, the process should be transparent to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data enrichment is often done because the client system does not have access to the data that the model needs to make a prediction. In this case, the client must provide a field that the model can use to find the fields that it needs to make a prediction. Once the data is loaded from a data source, the model can be called to make a prediction using the fields that it expects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, the client system is simply not the right place to manage the data that the model needs for predictions because of it's complexity. In this case, we would like to prevent the client system from having to manage data that really does not fall within it's natural responsabilities. In order to still allow the client system to still use the model, we can add data enrichment capabilities to the model deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data enrichment simplifies the work of the client system because a client system can simply provide a way to find the correct data to the deployed ML model. The model deployment is then responsible for going and fetching the correct record, join it to the data provided by the client system, and make a prediction. Data enrichment also prevents the client system from having to manage the data needed by the model, which keeps the two systems from becoming too coupled. By having the model access the data that it needs to make a prediction, the model can change the fields it needs without having to coordinate with the client system at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we’ll show how to create a simple decorator that is able to access a database in order to do data enrichment for an ML model that is deployed to a production system. We'll also show how to deploy the decorator along with the model to a RESTful service, and how to create the necessary database to hold the data."

    "\n",
    "The client system accesses the model by reaching out to the model service which hosts both the model and the decorator that we will be building in this blog post. The decorator is the software component that does the data enrichment needed by the model. The decorator reaches out to the database to access data needed by the model. \n",
